// Programming languages are eventually reduced to machine code or a series of 1/0 binary sequences. In this exercise you will be converting a javascript string into it's equivalent series of binary sequences. Binary sequences contain 8 digits and will only consist of 1s and 0s.

// Test your binary <--> text conversion here:

const name = "your name here";

// Convert text to binary
// ======================
text2Binary = str => {
  // code here
};
text2Binary(name);
