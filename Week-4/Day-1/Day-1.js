// Programming languages are eventually reduced to machine code or a series of 1/0 binary sequences. In this exercise you will be converting a javascript string into it's equivalent binary representation. Your binary sequences should contain 8 digits and will only consist of 1s and 0s. Return a single string with each binary representation separated by a space. Make sure you remove white space from the beginning and end of the string.

// Example:
// 'hello' === text2Binary ===> '01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111'

const name = "your name here";

// Convert text to binary
// ======================
text2Binary = str => {
  // Code Here ...
};
text2Binary(name);
